    When googlereader disappear, I was not really happy with
    available replacements. So I started to implement
    this module. I now use it on a regular basis.

    The module `pyquickhelper  <http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyquickhelper/helpsphinx/index.html>`_
    now generates a simple script which runs this module and gather the latest
    blog posts from any module based on pyquickhelper design.
